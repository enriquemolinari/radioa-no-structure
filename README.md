# RadioA Sample Application

This is RadioA, a small Java Swing application written with no structure (no architecture) at all. As part of the book [Coding an Architecture Style](https://leanpub.com/codinganarchitecturestyle), we will refactor it to show the implementation of differents architecture styles.

The book is completely **free** for my students (if you want to read it, just write to me).
